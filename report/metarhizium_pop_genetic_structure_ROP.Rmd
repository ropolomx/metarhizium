## Introduction

This analysis was performed to address the reviewers' comments on
Inglis et al., 2018 ("Biogeography and subspecies diversity of 
_Metarhizium brunneum_ and _Metarhizium robertsii_ in northwestern 
North America") submitted to the Canadian Journal of Microbiology.


## Methods

### Preparing data for analysis

The analysis was performed with the data provided by Jenny Gusse. After investigation,
isolate #2027 was correctly assigned as _M. robertsii_.

Some entries were dropped from the dataset because either they were completely absent from the _M. robertsii_
dataset (Ma375_3, Ma307_2, and Ma2296_2) or that were present in only one isolate in the _M. brunnei_ dataset (Ma307_2 and Ma2296_2).

### Population genetic structure

In order to analyze the population genetic structure, the STRUCTURE v.2.3.4 program 
[@pritchard_inference_2000] was run with the admixture model, 
correlated allele frequencies and locations as priors (LOCPRIORS). This was done for 
both the analysis of agricultural vs. natural habitat and glaciated vs. non-glaciated locations for both
_M. robertsii_ and _M. brunnei_. 
STRUCTURE is a Bayesian clustering method that finds the most likely number of clusters (K) 
that maximize Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and minimize linkage disequilibrium. 
Five independent runs for each value of K from 1 to 5 were 
run (10,000 burn-in periods with 20,000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) repetitions after 
burn-in.). Results were averaged and the true K value was determine using STRUCTURE HARVESTER web version 
v0.6.94 [@earl_structure_2012] by using the delta K (Evanno) and the mean log likelihood LnPr(X|K).

Fixation index (Fst) values were calculated for analyzing genetic differentiation.

## Results and Discussion

### Glaciated vs. non-glaciated locations

STRUCTURE analysis revealed that the true value of K was 3 clusters for 
_M.robertsii_ and K = 2 for _M. brunneum_.

In conclusion, the observations on population structure were 
consistent with the results described with the minimum spanning trees 
in the manuscript. Namely, there is no distinction between 
agricultural and natural isolates with minimum spanning tree, but 
there is clear distinction between isolates inside glaciation vs. 
outside glaciation.
